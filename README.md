# C Language Learning Journey 💻

Welcome to my C Language Learning Journey repository! This repository contains the programs and exercises I worked on while learning the fundamentals and advanced concepts of the C programming language. It's a collection of code that demonstrates my understanding and progress as I explore this powerful language.

## 🔍 About This Repository

This repository is a work-in-progress collection of various C programs that I developed while learning the language. Instead of being organized into specific categories, the files are added as I progress through different topics. Each file is a standalone example or exercise that helped me understand key concepts in C. The repository serves as both a learning tool for myself and a reference for anyone else who might be starting their journey with C.

Feel free to browse through the files to see different aspects of C programming, from basic syntax and operations to more advanced topics like pointers and data structures.

## 📚 Learning Resources

Here are some resources I found helpful while learning C:

- [GeeksforGeeks - C Programming Language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/)
- [TutorialsPoint - C Programming](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/)
- [C Language Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irqbmMNs2Bo&t=1509s)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate through the directories to explore the various C programs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aasthayuli/Programming-in-C
```

2. Compile and run any C program using a C compiler like gcc:

```bash
   gcc basics/hello-world.c -o hello-world./hello-world
```

## 🎯 Future Goals

Dive deeper into advanced C topics like file handling, threading, and network programming.
Implement more complex data structures and algorithms.
Contribute to open-source C projects to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.
